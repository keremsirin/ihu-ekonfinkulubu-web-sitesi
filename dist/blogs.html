For instance, irrigated wheat, which is the country’s major crop, contributes on average 6.3 per cent of the nation’s annual gross domestic product (GDP). The livestock and horticulture subsector covers almost 14 per cent of land and employs more than 2 million peo</span><span class="dots_en">...</span><span class="more_en">ple (World Bank, 2014). However, 40 years of war and a series of severe droughts have seriously affected Afghanistan’s agricultural sector (Miller, 2006). Apart from that, the country’s agricultural sector is said to be underutilised for a number of reasons. Firstly, there are large areas of fertile land in many provinces that are left idle owing to a lack of financing (Kawasaki et al., 2012). Secondly, the majority of farmers are unbankable and financially excluded. Farmers who do have banking access mostly cannot afford to obtain loans from banks owing to high interest rates and a lack of collateral (McCusker, 2005). With a view to reducing reliance on imported goods, the government is set to further develop the country’s agricultural sector by exploring possible financing means offered by Islamic finance. It is anticipated that this movement to rejuvenate agricultural production is critical to the reconstruction of Afghanistan (Kawasaki et al., 2012). The level of public awareness and acceptance of Islamic finance in Afghanistan has radically improved over time. Currently, 7 out of the 17 licensed financial institutions offer Sharīʿah-compliant services in the country. The country’s nascent Islamic finance industry has promising prospects. This paper, however, explores the possibility of adopting salam-based crowdfunding, a viable Islamic financial product innovation that is relevant to meeting the financing needs of the agricultural sector. The introduction of salam-based crowdfunding is imperative to the development of Afghanistan’s agricultural sector, primarily for production of seasonal foods and crops. Given the volatile and risky nature of agricultural markets, the features of the salam (forward sale) contract are anticipated to soothe commodity price fluctuations and push the country’s productivity level upward (Kaleem and Abdul Wajid, 2009). The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD, 2009) avers that not only local farmers, but also foreign-owned plantations, processing factories, storage facilities and fertiliser companies may need third-party financing to carry out their businesses. However, a number of factors frustrate the development of adequate financial services in rural areas in most developing countries. One of the important factors is transaction costs, which are higher in rural areas than urban areas owing to a more dispersed population and weak infrastructure. This study adopts a qualitative approach to explore the potential of salam-based crowdfunding as a mode of financing the agricultural sector in Afghanistan. Relevant literature on salam and crowdfunding has been reviewed; The Bank of Khartoum’s practice of salam transactions has been examined, and Islamic finance experts have been interviewed on the subject. This study is exploratory in nature as salam-based crowdfunding is still at a conceptual or incipient stage and is yet to be implemented in the market. The novelty of this paper lies in the proposed structure ofsalam-based crowdfunding. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides the background of Afghanistan’s agricultural sector and Islamic financial services development. The paper then reviews the concept of salam-based transactions and crowdfunding available in the existing literature. The following section describes the proposed structure of salam-based crowdfunding, and the last section summarises and concludes the paper.<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Quj8UelImPVprAJT9J3TTCzzQJdayeQO/view" target="_blank">For the full article, please click</a></span><button class="read_en">Read more</button></div></div><div class="blog-2"> <div class="blog-2-profile"><p class="blog-2-profile-author">Iftikhar Muhammad</p><p class="blog-2-profile-date">December 2019</p></div><div class="blog_post"><h2>Willingness to Pay for Renewable Electricity: A Contingent Valuation Study in Turkey</h2><span>Global energy needs have become an increasingly very important concern for all economies and the primary sources include fossil fuels such as oil coal and natural gas; all of which contribute over 80% of the global energy supply. These energy resources are dispersed across dif-ferent parts of the world; some of which are concentrated in unstable geographical areas where their use is compromised. Since they emit greenhouse gases, their eventual eﬀects on climate change especially in regard to threats to the  environment an</span><span class="dots_en">...</span><span class="more_en">d human health have become a matter of urgent concern. Attempts to seek remedial measures have greatly acknowledged the role of renewable energy sources in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, which cause climate change (Lee and Heo, 2016; Lloyd and Subbarao, 2009). Renewable energy has been defined as energy harnessed from green electricity sources such as hydroelectric power, wind, tide, solar and biomass power systems. Considering the threats of climate change, sustainability has become an important issue and it calls for a reduction of the use of fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas (IPCC, 2007; Moriarty and Honnery, 2009). Renewables have been considered vital elements of energy security, dynamic economic development, and environmental protection and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions reduction eﬀorts and have taken a new dimension of policy concern across many countries of the world (Nienhueser and Qiu, 2016; Carley, 2009; Johnstone et al., 2010; Marques et al., 2010). IEA energy forecasts project renewable energy as the fastest growing energy source in the world between now and 2030 with projections showing global electricity consumption of renewable energy at an average growth rate of 2.6% over 2007-2035. Eventually, the share of renewable energy in terms of electricity generation is to grow by 5% during the same period; meaning that it will grow from 18% in 2007 to 23% in 2035 (BP, 2012; EIA, 2006; EIA, 2010). The development of renewable energy sector will reduce foreign energy dependence and prevent reliance on current energy consump-tion which has resulted into destructive eﬀects on the environment, thus promoting sustainable development objectives (Kaygusuz, 2007; Payne, 2012). The government has the responsibility of compensating producers of renewable energy and investigating consumers’ preference if it wants to develop renewable energy. Thus, it must consider issues such as; households’ willingness to pay for use of renewable energy and factors which are likely to aﬀect their willingness to pay and also the ability of the government to support and subsidize renewable energy costs at both national and provisional levels. Turkey as a developing country has experienced rapid economic growth and its energy needs have been on top of their development agenda. Recent statistics indicate that Turkey’s Total Primary Energy Supply (TPES) was 129.7 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2015 and represent an increase of 54% compared to 2005 (IEA, 2016; DSI, 2015). Its energy sector has seen renewable energy constitutes 48.9% of total production with constituted as follows: hydro 17.9%, geothermal 14.8%, biomass 10.1%, wind 3.1% and solar 3% (IEA, 2016). Most of the country’s electricity demands are met by natural gas (38.6%) al-though a huge proportion of the natural gas is imported from diﬀerent countries. Coal follows with 28.3% making up 67.7% of total genera-tion from fossil fuels in 2015. The rapid increase in electricity demand with the annual approximation of 5% has also been witnessed (MMO, 2016). International Energy Agency (2012) data puts Turkey as one of the countries projected to use renewable energy technologies until 2017 and as a contending candidate to the European Union, the country is relentlessly investing in the energy sector as a strategy of meeting the clean energy requirements of the EU by 2023 when the share of re-newable energy in total energy consumption is at least 20% (TNRAP, 2014). Turkey has also an ambitious national energy goal of minimizing energy import and maximizing domestic energy until 2023. This is based on its 2010–2014 action plan framed by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Sources which will see the country produce 30% of elec-tricity from renewable energy sources (Kose et al., 2014; TNRAP, 2014). Willingness to Pay (WTP) plays a central role in directing appro-priate policy for the country to realize its ambitious renewable energy targets. Therefore, considering this discrepancy our study provides a new specific country case by estimating the WTP of the Turkish citizens for green electricity and also establishes various factors aﬀecting their WTP using the Contingent Valuation (CV) method. There is no previous study, to the best of our knowledge, focuses on WTP for renewable electricity in Turkey. Thus, this study intends to bridge this existing gap by investigating the WTP of the Turkish people based on social de-terminants variables such as age, income, marital status and education, and the applicability of a utility program in Turkey that enables citizens to support investment in renewable energy. This paper takes the following structural form. Section 2 makes reviews of previous discussions while Section 3 explains the research methodology followed and results presented in Section 4. Conclusions and policy implications are discussed in Section 5.<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gf8nvFzl396pXe0xqYDVVQYfkGQmijtF/view" target="_blank">For the full article, please click</a></span><button class="read_en">Read more</button></div></div><div class="blog-3"> <div class="blog-3-profile"><p class="blog-3-profile-author">Ayuba Napari</p><p class="blog-3-profile-date">December 2019</p></div><div class="blog_post"><h2>Monetary Policy and Income Inequality in Ghana</h2><span>Inequality is the partitioning of society into different groups based on which different groups are accorded different rights, privileges, opportunities, responsibilities or some form of it. In ‘The Republic’ by Plato, inequality is justified by the noble lie which associates societal status to creation itself as in the following paragraph. ‘So, god in fashioning out those who are competent to rule mixed gold in at their birth; this is why they are most honoured; in auxiliaries, silver; and iron and bronze in the farmers and th</span><span class="dots_en">...</span><span class="more_en">e other craftsmen ……….. There is an oracle that the city will be destroyed when an iron or bronze is made its guardian’ (Bloom, 1968, p. 94)This ‘noble lie’ was used not only to justify the status of the rulers as being ordained by the gods to rule but also to ensure that the status quo of ‘born unequal’ is never questioned. Some form of this noble lie could have been the underpinning philosophy of the slave trade, the holocaust and racism where it was/is thought that a particular race is supposedly made of the bronze and iron and are naturally obliged to labour for the gold race or to say the least (i.e. the gold race) should be given precedence over the bronze and iron races which are supposedly less valuable. This social stratification in status is a corollary for the inequality of rights and opportunities in education, health, gender, income, wealth, employment and all other forms of inequality imaginable. Mention must be made of the fact that in the utopian form of the noble lie, status mobility was made to sound straight forward and meritorious allowing people of guardian parentage to become auxiliaries or farmers if they so tend out to be of an admixture of silver or of iron and bronze. In reality, however, intergenerational transfer of status particularly in political power and wealth is the norm. Feiveson and Sabelhaus (2018) found intergenerational transfer of wealth to be a key explanatory factor of wealth concentration with the transfer being directly through inheritance or indirectly through access to better education. Political power has also been seen transferred through family lines perhaps due to the grooming accomplished politicians give to their children and also through their networks. This is particularly true for African countries like Togo, Kenya and Congo where political power has been passed down from father to son with the sons perhaps only reaching those feet due to their parentage. Even though all forms of inequality are of concern, income inequality is considered one of the troubling forms of inequality of our time with the income of top earners increasing faster than the rest of the population (Ingraham, 2019 ). Prior to colonialism, income inequality in what became Ghana was considerably low. However, this rose sharply during colonialism with the income Gini rising from 0.30 in 1891 to 0.55 in 1960 (Aboagye & Bolt, 2018). This rise in inequality in Ghana during colonialism and afterwards generally has been spatial with rising incomes in southern Ghana and stagnant or at worse falling incomes in Northern Ghana due to geographical factors like climate, weather and physical resource endowment (Tsikata & Seini, 2004). Also, the concentration of colonial missionaries and missionary activities is found by Boateng, Okoye, Amoyaw, and Luginaah (2017) to have some explanatory power regarding the observed inequality in Ghana. It is concluded in Obeng‐Odoom (2012) that the increase in urban income inequality in Ghana is attributable to the increased neo-liberal economic policies of recent times. These neo-liberal economic policies in the financial and monetary sector started with the Financial Sector Adjustment Program (FINSAP) in 1989 and culminated in the Bank of Ghana Act 2002 that declares the Bank of Ghana an inflation targeting central bank (Quartey & Afful-Mensah, 2014) in 2002. Since 2002, the income Gini has risen consistently.<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OVGj2_X_13QGdTugHQDUBKpt5tOt1HMv/view" target="_blank">For the full article, please click</a></span><button class="read_en">Read more</button></div></div><div class="blog-4"> <div class="blog-3-profile"><p class="blog-4-profile-author">Iftikhar Muhammad</p><p class="blog-4-profile-date">March 2020</p></div><div class="blog_post"><h2>Nexus Between Willingness to Pay for Renewable Energy Sources: Evidence from Turkey</h2><span>Human energy needs have increased dramatically in tandem with technological change and economic development in re-cent years. Also, economic growth has become largely depen-dent on energy. The world energy system is focused largely on non-renewable energy sources (coal, oil, and natural gas), leading to more than 80% of the world economy’s overall energy supply (IEA 2016). Nonetheless, several significant problems have arisen in recent years, associated with the use of non-renewable energy sources such as the rising gap in th</span><span class="dots_en">...</span><span class="more_en">e demand and supply of energy worldwide (Nematollahi et al. 2016), the growing threat of oil reserve depletion (Bettini and Lazaros 2013), and an increase in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere (LPR 2014). The carbon emitted from the consumption and production of non-renewable ener-gy sources is now acknowledged as the main cause of the ecological crisis facing mankind (LPR 2014). In recent years, the production of renewable/green energy sources (RES) has gained momentum due to various energy sector crises. According to the IEA (2014) report, the contribution of renewable energy sources to reducing carbon emissions will be highest by the year 2050. Currently, green energy accounts for 19.3% of global energy demand and con-tributes substantially to GHG emission reduction (REN21 2017). Research by Fang (2011) showed that green energy usage could help reduce GHG emissions by about 8.2% by 2050. There are also clear economic benefits of utilizing clean energy technologies. RES can reduce reliance on imported non-renewable energy sources and address the energy access problems for more than 1.4 billion people worldwide facing energy poverty (Sovacool 2013). The deployment of green energy could also contribute to job creation (Cai et al. 2011) and encouraging the development of small-scale businesses in developing countries (Kanase-Patil et al. 2010). The usage of RES is rapidly growing in both developed and developing countries, including Turkey. Turkey has de-veloped an action plan designed by the Ministries of Power and Natural Resources (MPNR) to reduce energy imports, increase domestic energy supply and produce 30% of the total electricity from RES by 2023. The biggest challenge to attain this goal is the incredibly high cost of producing green energy. The investments needed for renewables are massive and con-ventional subsidies cannot reach them. The government should take concrete measures to reimburse producers for higher costs and ask consumers about their preferences to encourage the deployment of green electricity in the region. Nonetheless, a range of concerns need to be resolved be-fore policy formulation, for example, (1) are Turkish citizens prepared to pay a surcharge to support renewable energy over and above local and national subsidies? What is their willing-ness to pay (WTP) for 20% and 30% of share renewable electricity in total electricity generation? What are the factors that influence their WTP?. Therefore, the primary objectives of this study are to examine the Turkish citizens’ WTP for green/renewable energy and to analyze the factors affecting their WTP using one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA). Interviews were conducted face-to-face compris-ing 2500 households in 12 major metropolitan cities of Turkey based on the contingent valuation method consisting of a total of 26 questions. The study consists of the following sections: literature review, data set, method and application, findings and discussion, conclusions, and policy implications.<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15yqdAMk2RN71xA29Qtyxy91LoMHmh3Ts/view" target="_blank">For the full article, please click</a></span><button class="read_en">Read more</button></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="Footer"><div class="Footer-color-top"><div class="container"><div class="Footer-top"><div class="Footer-top-logo"><img src="/ihulogobeyazen.8e707ff9.svg"><p>Basak Mah.
